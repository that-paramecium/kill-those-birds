A small console based calculator I made in python.

---------------------------------------------------------

So, this is a short project I made as a sort of "intro" to python.  It's rather simple, but I like it

Anyway, Here is a list of commands and their requirments

when typing in the calculator, type in lowercase

1. factoring - has three inputs, used as a thing to factor a quadratic trinomial
2. arithmetic - has four sub-inputs (add, subt, mult, divide), self explanitory
3. square - actually a misnomer, it raises a number given to a power given
4. root - opposite of square, same inputs
